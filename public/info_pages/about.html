			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>Thank you for visiting Tofo.me (the "Site") and reviewing the Privacy Policy Tofo.me ("Tofo.me", "We", "Us", "Our" ). By
				using or accessing the Site, you expressly consent to Our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information
				as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

				once you have sent us your identifiable personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us.
				<br> We collect two types of information from Users of the Site: “Automatic Anonymous Information” (AAI) and “Identifiable
				Personal Information” (IPI). We process AAI and IPI differently, and the following articles describe both AAI and IPI
				and indicate how each type of information is collected and used by Tofo.me.
				<br> The Site make it possible to monitor certain information automatically, based on your behaviour. This information does
				not identify you personally. We use this information to improve the Content and functionality of the Site, and to better
				understand and satisfy our visitors. This information may include the browser you use, your IP address or other information.
				This information is referred to herein as the AAI.
				<br> IPI is individually identifiable information about you that allows us to identify or contact you. Some of the Site’s
				functions require asking you for certain IPI, such as your instagram username, instagram password and/or other personal
				information.
				<br> But we do not handle your Instagram passwords directly. We use Instagram's API and OAuth 2.0 protocol to authorize Our
				users. Our databases are secured with passwords to guard against unauthorized access of Our systems. Only engineer staff
				members may access data on a need-to-know basis.
				<br> You may choose to provide IPI in order to access certain functions on the Site. You can always choose not to provide
				certain information, but in that case it may be that you cannot use certain of the Site’s functions.
				<br> </p>
			<p>
				<strong>1.2 Shared information</strong>
				<br> We may be required by law enforcement, government administrators, and/or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable
				information. We will disclose personally identifiable information upon receipt of a court order, or if required to co-operate
				with law enforcement, administrative or other governmental agencies. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement
				agencies any activities that We in good faith believe to be unlawful.
				<br> Our service providers who help with Our business operations and employees on a need-to-know basis. Third parties to whom
				you explicitly ask Us to send your information or you consent to and are notified when using a specific service. Business
				entities, if We plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity, should such a change in control occur. </p>
